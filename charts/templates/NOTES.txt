Kube-Trash is a measure designed to record and prevent accidental deletion of resources on Kubernetes. It only requires pre-configuration of the resources to be "protected" and the storage object (which only needs to be S3-compatible).
Note: If you encounter errors like `Failed to watch *unstructured.Unstructured` in the logs, you can ignore them. Many resources do not define their Kind according to the standard, but this does not affect our processing logic.
